# Add/Remove Resolvment

The scripts add and remove domain name resolutions within the hosts file. 
- When a resolution is removed, during a query, since there is no resolution in the hosts file, the query will be forwarded to the DNS server, which attempts to resolve the domain name to an IP address.
